# Smart Student Hub

A centralized **mobile + web** application to catalogue, verify, and showcase student achievements, activities, and academic records throughout their college life. The Smart Student Hub helps students maintain a verified, shareable portfolio while enabling institutions to generate reports and streamline accreditation (NAAC, NIRF, AICTE) and administrative tasks.

## Project Overview

Studentsâ€™ achievements are often fragmented across departments, paper files, or unofficial personal records. *Smart Student Hub* provides:

* A **verified** digital portfolio for students with faculty/admin approvals.
* Centralized data for institutions to generate accreditation-ready reports.
* Integrations with LMS/ERP for automated record ingestion.

This repository contains (or will contain) the backend APIs, frontend web app, and mobile app skeleton plus infra and deployment scripts.

---

## Key Features

* **Dynamic Student Dashboard**: GPA, attendance, credits, recent activities.
* **Activity Tracker**: Create entries for workshops, internships, MOOCs, competitions, volunteering.
* **Faculty/Admin Approval Workflow**: Multi-tier approval with notifications.
* **Auto-generated Portfolio**: Downloadable PDF + shareable web profile URL.
* **Reports & Analytics**: Exportable reports for NAAC/NIRF/AICTE and departmental dashboards.
* **Integrations**: LMS (Moodle/Canvas), University ERP, SSO (CAS/SAML/OAuth).
* **Role-based Access Control**: Student, Faculty, HOD, Admin, Placement Officer.
* **Verification & Security**: Digital certificate verification; optional blockchain anchoring.
* **Search & Filter**: Search student achievements, filter by year/department/type.
* **Notifications**: Email / in-app push notifications for approvals, deadlines, events.

---

## Target Users & Impact

* Students: maintain a verified CV-like portfolio across their academic lifecycle.
* Faculty: verify, mentor, and recommend students easily.
* Admin / Accreditation teams: produce consolidated reports for audits and ranking submissions.
* Placement Cells: faster verification and sharing of student accomplishments with recruiters.

## Recommended Tech Stack

> Pick a stack that matches your team skills. Below is a suggested modern full-stack choice.

**Backend**

* Node.js + Fastify (or Express) with TypeScript
* PostgreSQL (Relational data + reporting)
* Sequelize / TypeORM for ORM
* Redis for caching / job queue and short-lived tokens
* BullMQ or RabbitMQ for background jobs (PDF generation, email sending)

**Frontend (Web)**

* React + TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS for styling
* React Query or SWR for data fetching
* Vite or Next.js (Next if SSR or SSG for public portfolios)

**Mobile**

* React Native or Flutter (shared component patterns)

**Auth & Identity**

* JWT for API auth + refresh tokens
* Optional SSO integrations (SAML/CAS/OAuth2) for campus-wide identity

**Storage & Media**

* AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage or Cloudinary for certificate uploads
* CDN for serving public portfolio assets

**DevOps & Infra**

* Docker + Docker Compose for local dev
* Kubernetes / AWS ECS or DigitalOcean App Platform for production
* GitHub Actions / GitLab CI for CI/CD

**Optional**

* Blockchain anchoring (e.g., Ethereum or Hyperledger) for tamper-evident certificates
* ElasticSearch for fast search across activities
* Metabase / Superset for ad-hoc analytics

---

## High-level Architecture

1. **Clients**: Web app (React), Mobile (React Native), Admin portal (React)
2. **API Layer**: Fastify backend exposing REST/GraphQL endpoints
3. **Services**:

   * Authentication Service
   * Profile & Achievements Service
   * Approval Workflow Service
   * Reporting & Analytics Service
   * Notification Service
4. **Data Stores**:

   * Primary DB: PostgreSQL
   * Blob Storage: S3/Cloudinary
   * Cache / Queue: Redis

Background jobs (PDF generation, bulk import, report exports) run in worker containers.

---

## Database Schema (conceptual)

> This is a simplified conceptual schema to get started.

* `users` (id, name, email, role, department\_id, created\_at)
* `students` (user\_id -> users.id, roll\_no, enrollment\_year, program, gpa)
* `departments` (id, name, hod\_id)
* `achievements` (id, student\_id, title, type, category, description, date, proof\_url, status, credits, created\_at)
* `approvals` (id, achievement\_id, approver\_id, role, status, comments, actioned\_at)
* `certificates` (id, achievement\_id, issuer, issue\_date, verification\_hash)
* `events` (id, title, type, organizer, date)
* `activity_logs` (id, user\_id, action, object\_type, object\_id, created\_at)
* `reports` (id, department\_id, type, params, generated\_by, link)

**Indexes & partitions**: partition `achievements` by year or department for faster reporting on large datasets.

---

## API Endpoints (sample)

> Provide REST examples; you can also offer GraphQL later.

**Auth**

* `POST /api/auth/signup` - register user
* `POST /api/auth/login` - login (returns access & refresh token)
* `POST /api/auth/refresh` - refresh access token

**Students & Profiles**

* `GET /api/students/:id` - get profile & achievements
* `PUT /api/students/:id` - update profile
* `GET /api/students/:id/portfolio` - get shareable portfolio

**Achievements**

* `POST /api/achievements` - create achievement (uploads proof)
* `GET /api/achievements?studentId=...&status=approved` - query
* `GET /api/achievements/:id` - get single achievement
* `PUT /api/achievements/:id` - edit
* `DELETE /api/achievements/:id` - delete (soft delete recommended)

**Approvals**

* `POST /api/achievements/:id/approve` - approver action with comments
* `GET /api/approvals/pending` - list pending approvals for approver

**Reports**

* `POST /api/reports/generate` - generate NAAC/NIRF report (async)
* `GET /api/reports/:id` - download generated report

**Search**

* `GET /api/search?query=&type=achievements&year=`

---

## Authentication & Security

* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: student, faculty, admin, hod, placement\_officer
* **Secure file uploads**: signed URLs to S3, virus scanning in upload pipeline
* **Rate limiting & logging**: API gateway with request throttling
* **Data privacy**: GDPR-like controls (data export & delete requests)
* **Certificate verification**: store cryptographic hash when issuing certificates

---

## Installation & Local Setup (developer)

> Minimal local setup using Docker Compose

1. Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/smart-student-hub.git
cd smart-student-hub
```

2. Create `.env` from `.env.example` and fill variables (DB URL, S3, JWT secrets)

3. Start dev services

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

4. Run DB migrations & seeders

```bash
# inside backend container
npm run migrate
npm run seed
```

5. Start frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

6. Open `http://localhost:3000`

---

## Deployment Ideas

* Use CI to build docker images and push to a registry.
* Deploy backend & workers to Kubernetes (EKS/GKE) with autoscaling.
* Use managed Postgres (RDS / Cloud SQL) and S3 for storage.
* Use CloudFront or Fastly as CDN for public portfolios.
* Set up scheduled backups, monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana), and alerting.

---

## Testing & QA

* Unit tests for services & controllers (Jest / Vitest)
* Integration tests for critical flows (auth, upload & approval)
* E2E tests for UI (Playwright / Cypress)
* Load testing for report generation (k6 / artillery)

---

## Roadmap & Future Enhancements

* OAuth / campus SSO integration
* Blockchain-backed certificate anchoring
* AI recommendations (events, courses, skill gaps)
* Alumni networking and verification
* Integration with employer portals for one-click portfolio sharing
* Mobile-first UX improvements and offline support
